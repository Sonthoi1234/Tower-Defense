                <p>This is the latest beta version for TDG 1.8.0.<br>
                Currently it has a lot of bugs, so I'll try my best to fix it soon.<br>
                A notable bug was wth the upgrades, but I won't dive in too deep to the topic.</p>

                <p>An older version of the game, mainly an update for TDG 1.6.0.<br>
                This version does not support turret selling and didn't have Forest maps, so it was kinda empty.</p>

                <p>This update is pretty old, so don't expect this to have many features yet.<br>
                 The update added Gear and Electric turrets, which are still in the game to this day.<br>
                 Gear turret was broken after 1.6.0 (where upgrades were added), but the bug was fixed after the latest 1.8.0 beta came out</p>
